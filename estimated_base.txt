To make this estimation I need to make initial assumptions:
	- Total customers to serve (probably future addition to customers is calculated for not to reconsider shortage in short terms if every person aged over 10 is using a cellphone that is nearly %80 of population 20.000.000 x 0,8 = 16.000.000)
	- Data rate: how much data+calls roaming (estimate according to the busy periods like holidays) x
	- How much coverage base stations serve (radius to 0 - 10km)
	- Istanbul's area (app. 5300 km2)

According to data I've assumed people density in Istanbul is about 3000 people per km2

In Turkey, the average density is 110 people per km2 so I assume the 10km range is valid for 110 people density.

So for 110 people with x traffic 110x traffic base station can serve to 10km radius best case.

If 1:1 inverse ratio applies in here and addition to that if we assume people living metropole is average having 1.5 traffic but to handle worst cases might be up to 2x: 

3000 * 2x = 6000x traffic should be served.It's nearly 55 times of average so if we divide 10km radius to 55 from inverse ratio average radius coverage of the base station is: 0,18km

Number of the base stations in target area = Total area to cover / average coverage of the base station

Coverage area = π * r² = π * 0.0324km² ≈ 0.10179km²

5300 / 0.1 = 53000 is the estimated number.
